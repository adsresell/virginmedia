    <h1>Join Virgin Media &amp; claim a cashback reward</h1>
    <p class="hero-sub">
      Use the official Virgin Media refer‑a‑friend link to order broadband, TV or a bundle. If your order qualifies and is confirmed,
      both you and your referrer receive a cash reward paid out via Aklamio.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <a class="btn-primary" href="https://virginmedia.aklamio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Get my Virgin Media cashback
      </a>
      <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:#9ca3af;margin-top:4px;">
        Exact reward amount and eligible packages are shown on the official Virgin Media page.
      </p>

    <h2>Why join Virgin Media through a referral?</h2>

    <h3>Cash reward for you and your friend</h3>
    <p>
      When you sign up with a tracked referral link and take out an eligible package, a cash bonus is reserved for both you and
      the person who referred you, once Virgin Media validates the order.
    </p>

    <h3>Same deals, plus a bonus</h3>
    <p>
      You still choose from Virgin Media’s usual offers on ultrafast broadband, TV and phone. The referral just adds a cashback
      reward on top if you meet the terms.
    </p>

    <h3>Simple online journey</h3>
    <p>
      The referral page sends you straight into the normal ordering flow. Place your order online and keep your services active
      beyond the cooling‑off period so your reward remains eligible.
    </p>

    <h3>Tracked and paid via Aklamio</h3>
    <p>
      Your reward is handled by Aklamio, the platform that runs the scheme. You’ll see your referral in your account and can
      withdraw the money once it moves from pending to confirmed.
    </p>

    <h2>Happy customers, real rewards</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “Signing up through the Virgin Media refer‑a‑friend link meant I got the deal I wanted on broadband and a nice cashback

    <h2>Joining through referral – step by step</h2>

    <h3>Get to the referral portal</h3>
    <p>
      Start by clicking the button on this page. You’ll be taken to the official Virgin Media referral portal powered by Aklamio.
    </p>

    <h3>Choose your Virgin Media package</h3>
    <p>
      From there, follow the links to pick the broadband, TV or bundle that suits you and complete your order.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation and activation</h3>
    <p>
      Your services are installed or activated in the usual way. Keep them running beyond the cancellation period so your reward
      can be confirmed.
    </p>

    <h3>Reward confirmed and paid</h3>
    <p>
      Once Virgin Media confirms your order, your reward in Aklamio moves to confirmed and you can cash out to your chosen
      payout method, such as bank account or PayPal.
    </p>

    <h2>Useful info &amp; FAQs</h2>

    <h3>How much cashback is available?</h3>
    <p>
      The reward amount depends on current Virgin Media promotions and the type of package you choose. The latest value is always
      shown on the official referral page once you click through.
    </p>

    <h3>When will I be paid?</h3>
    <p>
      After your service is installed or delivered and the cooling‑off period has passed, your order is checked. When Virgin Media
      confirms it, your reward becomes payable in Aklamio and you can withdraw it.
    </p>

    <h3>Who can use the scheme?</h3>
    <p>
      The refer‑a‑friend offer is usually for new Virgin Media customers at addresses that don’t already have a Virgin Media service.
      Some tariffs and staff or partner offers don’t qualify. Always read the current terms on the official site.
    </p>

    <h3>What if my reward doesn’t appear?</h3>
    <p>
      Log in to your Aklamio account to check the status. If something looks wrong, you can raise a claim via the help section on
      the referral portal so the team can look into it.
    </p>
